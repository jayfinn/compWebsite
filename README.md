if timezone errors occur, download new timezone files from pytz source files found online and swap them out in the pytz folder (init__py, etc)

To change requirements, in comp.py, change the numbers next to "quantity" in each section corresponding to each department.  To add a new requirement, add a new section in the brackets and set the properties including board, event type, quantity and notes.
